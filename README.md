## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/60855-ruad-rofhessa-item-upgrade-updated-to-v29-with-ee-compatibility/">report them on the forum!</a><br>

>Although it is not required for Hubelpot the Vegetable Merchant to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-hubelpot.exe`__, un-install all previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: __hubelpot__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

hubelpot for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: hubelpot folder and a setup-hubelpot.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-hubelpot.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-hubelpot.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

hubelpot for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: hubelpot folder, setup-hubelpot and setup-hubelpot.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-hubelpot.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-hubelpot.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

hubelpot for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-hubelpot`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-hubelpot --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *`DESIGNATED`* number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.

## <a name="versions" id="versions"></a>Version History

##### Version (June 30, 2020)

- Added *hubelpot.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Renamed *setup-hubelpot.tp2* -> *hubelpot.tp2* to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
- Fixed a typo in `HANDLE_CHARSETS` function (replaced *infer_charset* with *infer_charset<ins>s</ins>*).
- Added `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games (replaced old `ACTION_IF NOT FILE_EXISTS "Data/25Dialog.bif"` process).
- Added components `DESIGNATED` numbers and "*ruad_soa*" and "*ruad_tob*" `LABELS`.
- Added "*always.tpa*" library.
- Externalized tp2 code into *ruad_soa.tpa* and *ruad_tob.tpa* libraries for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
- Added native EET, 1PP and ToBEx compatibility.
- Commented code as much as possible.
- Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify traditional inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games. The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the *override* folder.
- Inventory item icons: fixed wrong transparency index (pure green [0.255.0] replaces old turquoise - a pretty annoying BAMWorkshop leftover :astonished:).
- dialog and script files: added Chapters compatibility with EET (variables *%bg2_chapter_n%* are evaluated to set continuity chapter numbers).
- ruad.d: removed *DestroyAllEquipment()* action whenever possible.
- Included BWP Fixpack Luca Piol's typo fix for ruad.d: replaced wrong misc6s item (Chunk of Illithium Alloy) with misc6w (Wooden Stake) to create Wooden Stake (u#blun03.itm).
- Provided a Ruad portrait for EE game.
- Second component (#10): removed `AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT` command and added a require main component process, otherwise mod will crash the game if first component is not installed.
- Added foreign languages WeiDU prompts whenever possible.
- Renamed "*titles*" and "*setup*" .tra files to more accurate "*setup*" and "*items*" .tra files.
- Updated *items.tra* files for compatibility with `GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE` WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games. And fixed restriction flags whenever relevant.
- Updated and renamed readme file to *ruad-readme-english.txt*, then moved it into new "*readme*" folder.
- Renamed "*american*" language folder to "*english*".
- Removed unused files.
- Included Linux and Mac Os X versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN's Infinity Auto Packager tool!).
- Added archive libiconv-1.9.2-1-src.7z with iconv licence info.
- Uploaded mod to official Spellhold Studios GitHub mirror account.
