- Create kits abilities bam files. The mod uses the items inventory bams and and it would be better to resize them to 28 x 28 pixels to fit the game standard.

    - Village Druid: May cast one fewer spell per spell level than a standard Druid
	- Vegetable Farmer: Can reduce prices in shopping from merchants, due to his supreme haggling-skills
==> An extensive testing may check if I am right or wrong...
